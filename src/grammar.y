%{
// This file contains a Bison grammar for RCL. It is not intended to be used
// directly, there is a hand-written recursive descent parser in src/parser.rs
// instead. However to inform the structure of the hand-written one, it is nice
// to have the grammar in a concise format that is readable by humans and
// machines. In particular, Bison will warn about ambiguities.

// The grammar aims to be parsable with a recursive descent parser, but it's not
// strictly LL(k) because some rules contain left recursion. All of the cases
// that do though, have a clear token immediately following to still decide the
// production.

// Inspect with: bison --feature=syntax-only -Wcounterexamples src/grammar.y
